For this part of the coarsework, I had decided to gather all the languages that are being used by the user in the repos and plot the gathered data by using a pie chart. The gathered data is stored in a Python dictionary where the Key == language and Value == #bytes of that language. Forked repos will not be taken into account. I personally find this information to be interesting, especially when looking at open source projects.

This statistic is developed using python flask and Charts.js. You can experiment with the chart [--HERE--](https://powerful-oasis-29380.herokuapp.com/)
